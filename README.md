## üóû Publications
<br>

**Insights into the Phase Diagram of Pluronic L64 Using Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations** @ [_J. Phys. Chem. B,_ 2022, 126, 25, 4731‚Äì4744](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c02429) 
Mangesh Bhendale, Arpita Srivastava, and Jayant K. Singh*<br>
  - Investigated the phases of Pluronic L64 in water using CG molecular dynamics simulation.
  - Used derived bonded interactions using Boltzmann Inversion (BI) along with Martini non-bonded parameters.
  - Captured the experimentally observed micellar-, hexagonal-, lamellar-, and polymer-rich solution phases. 
  - Used the two-phase thermodynamics (2PT) method to calculate the entropy and free energy of the observed phases.
<br><br>

**Molecular Insights on Morphology, Composition, and Stability of Mixed Micelles Formed by Ionic Surfactant and Nonionic Block Copolymer in Water Using Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations** @ [_Langmuir,_ 2023, 39, 14, 5031‚Äì5040](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00045)  <br>
Mangesh Bhendale and Jayant K. Singh*<br>
  - Investigated the mixed micellization of Pluronic L64/L61 and Sodiun dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in aqueous solution using CG molecular dynamics simulation.
  - the core of the pluronic + SDS formed mixed micelles consists of PPO, the alkyl tail of SDS, and some water molecules, whereas the PEO, water, and sulfate headgroups of SDS form a shell, consistent with experimental observations.
  - Free energy analysis using umbrella sampling suggests a stronger tendency for SDS to form pluronic-SDS mixed micelles.

**Does freezing induce self-assembly of polymers? A molecular dynamics study** @ [_Soft Matter,_ 2023, 19, 7570-7579](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3SM00892D)  <br>
Mangesh Bhendale, Aindrila Indra, and Jayant K. Singh*<br>
  - This work explores the freezing-induced self-assembly (FISA) of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and PVA-like polymers using molecular dynamics simulations.
  - The effect of the degree of supercooling, degree of polymerization, polymer type, and initial local concentration on the FISA was thoroughly investigated.
  - The preeminent factor responsible for FISA is the increase in the polymer's local concentration upon freezing of the solvent and not the diffusion of the polymers away from the nucleating ice front.
  - This study brings molecular insights into the quintessential factors governing self-assembly via freezing of the solvent, which is a novel self-assembly technique especially suitable for biomedical applications.

**Understanding the role of polymers on the nucleating behaviour of water in dilute supercooled solutions** @ [_The Journal of Chemical Physics,_**(Accepted)**]()  <br>
Aindrila Indra,# Mangesh Bhendale,# and Jayant K. Singh*<br>
  - Used Seeding simulations methodology along with classical nucleation theory (CNT) to investigated ice nucleation in presence of PVA and PVA like polymers.
  - Observed a decrease in the nucleation rate of water with an increase in the polymer concentration.
  - Our results suggest the non-classical origins of ice nucleation in polymeric solutions and the limitation of the CNT in predicting heterogeneous ice nucleation in polymeric solutions.
<br><br>

**Does supercooled water retain its universal nucleation behavior under shear at high pressure?** @ [_Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, **(Accepted)**]()  <br>
Snehitha Srirangam,# Mangesh Bhendale,# and Jayant K. Singh*<br>
  - Used Seeding simulations methodology along with extended classical nucleation theory to investigated ice nucleation under shear at high pressures.
  - The dependence of nucleation rate with shear at higher pressure is non-monotonic, with the maximum at optimal shear rates between 10^7
to 10^8 s^‚àí1.
  - Our results demonstrate a non-monotonic pressure dependence of the optimal shear rates, which could originate from a violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation.
